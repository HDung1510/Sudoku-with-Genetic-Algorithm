Developed an AI-based Sudoku solver using a Genetic Algorithm to find valid solutions for 9x9 Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels. Defined initial and goal states, and designed key components such as mutation (preserving fixed hints), crossover (using Cycle Crossover to maintain valid rows), and a fitness function that maximizes uniqueness across rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids.
